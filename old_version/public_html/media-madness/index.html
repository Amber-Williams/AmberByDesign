  <h1>Media Madness</h1>
  <h2>A party game for friends | <a href="https://mediamadness-client.herokuapp.com/"> User link here </a>| <a href="https://mediamadness-client.herokuapp.com/central"> Central link here </a></h2>
  <p>First I planned out what screens I would need and how they would interact with through the information articture. I researched a bit for what the general layout should look like with other similar competitor products. Because I was on a tight schedule I did not put in much of the design phase as I normally would. </p>

  <p>After this I looked up what open source data was available online to generate a lot of questions for my game. The site I ended up using was https://crhallberg.com/cah/ . Considering this helped generate 688 of the type questions I need, I saved a LOAD of time rather then thinking of them myself.</p>

  <p>Following this I implemented Socket.io to communicate users to and from a central screen. After this was working, I added the GIPHY Search API so that user’s could search for a GIF to submit to the game round’s question. The API was pretty straight forward and renders 25 GIF’s per request and has many options for sizing and media type. I really liked the fact that they credit their sources per each GIF.</p>

  <p>I needed a way to track who was submitting which GIF’s which was easy through socket.id. However, I realized on disconnect, say I go to check my texts during the game and come back to the game, that the socket id changes. Storing the socket.id in the user’s localStorage and using that as verification was the way I could reestablish connection upon a “accidental” disconnect.</p>

  <p>Once this was completed, I set up a MongoDB database table to capture each GIF submission to later use for calculating winners/round stats. I also cleared the database table when all user’s disconnect from the room. This means that my database is really low cost and can stay low cost long term.</p>
