    #### 1. Planning
      * Built for reusability, scalability, with testing in mind
      * Git flow: Early on I wanted to create feature by feature commits squashed into one commit per feature -> PR -> merge to master and create new feature branches off the newest master to keep features clean
      * Created a rough drawing mock up of how the app would work and components within each element

    #### 2. Building
      * Next.js created basic app with React then refactored it using Typescript 
      * Added Airbnb’s strict linter, Prettier for formatting early on with pre-commit hooks to help with clean code and faster iteration. Also added pre-push hook to check if type script was up to standards via Prettier
          * I would have liked to of added in a stricter linter for Typescript like TSLint
      * Bootstrap was added to help minimize time spent on custom styling
      * Following this I knew I wanted to have dynamic routing used for each of the case studies to A) fetch the yaml file and B) fetch the appropriate information needed for the request
      * Created and styled case study component page
      * Created and styled case studies list component for index page
      * Testing backbone was created to run tests before pushing commits, though in the future I want this to be done in a CircleCi test that runs on the pushes and is needed to pass before merging a PR into master.

    #### 4. Connected domain to AWS Amplify for server hosting
      * Amplify was connected to my portfolio-website repo’s master branch so continuous deploys are easy and seamless each update to master.
