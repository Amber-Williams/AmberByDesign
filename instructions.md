There is a business requirement to create a solution. The solution is used by Estate Agents for various tasks.

One of the tasks is manage listings on Property Portals.

Manage listings entails the following:

* View listings
* Expire listings

We recommend you use a tool like [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock the data, rather than build out any APIs.

A listing contains the following:

* An image
* Number of bedrooms
* Address
* Postcode
* Description
* Asking price
* Expired

Taking advantage of the advances in technology and industry standards, create a simple application that can perform the tasks outlined above. 

Below is visual design of the listings card we would like you to build. Please note we do not expect you to add all of the features within the visual design.

For the purposes of this challenge use what you prefer for tactically storing the information (session storage, file storage, database), stating however your preferred solution should you implement a full solution.

The technical interview will be a discussion about the application you have created. Have a think about automation pipelines and any infrastructure that may be required for the application. We're not expecting a fully functional solution so we recommend spending **up to 4 hours**.

We're looking for the following:

* Easy to maintain
* Easy to scale
* Easy to pickup
* Responsive
* Automated tests
* Accessibility
* Beautifully semantic code

Feel free to make and state assumptions on any details not covered in the challenge.
